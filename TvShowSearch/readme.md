- Search for TV shows by their names.
- View more detailed information about TV shows, including:
  * Show title.
  * Official TVmaze page link.

--> Technologies Used
    ##Frontend
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript

    --> API
    - [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api): Provides the data about TV shows.

--> üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
1. You enter the name of a TV show in the search bar.
2. The application sends an asynchronous request to the TVmaze API.
3. The API responds with a list of shows matching the search query.
4. The results are dynamically displayed on the page, including the title, summary, image, and a link to the official TVmaze page.
