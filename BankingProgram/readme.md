This is a simple Banking Program/ATM Machine that is inspired by a tutorial from Bro Code on Youtube. While the original tutorial was implemented solely in Python, this version has been significantly enhanced with a full-stack approach. It features a backend powered by Python and MySQL, as well as frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code has also been refactored into an object-oriented programming (OOP) structure.
