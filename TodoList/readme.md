This is a small To-Do list project where you can view, add, delete, or mark tasks as done. It uses a backend to manage tasks and a frontend to provide an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
The backend is built with Python (Flask) and MySQL while the frontend uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
